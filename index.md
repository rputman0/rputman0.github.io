# About Me
Welcome! Bienvenidos! Bienvenue! Yokoso!

My passion for Computer Science was cemented when I learned **I could create something from nothing.**
Having that kind of free reign, and possibility got me excited about the possibilities that I could
explore! I will take on any challenge that awaits for me in the realm of Computer Science!
I am confident that if you hire me, that I will exceed your expectations and go beyond what
is expected of me to create!

I recall making my first program. A rudimentary "Hello World" program, but I was
excited that I could create something from nothing! From that basic program, I realized
I had vast possibilities on what I could create, with imagination as my only limit!

Computer Science correlated with another passion of mine: movies.<br /> 
I remember watching *Lady and the Tramp*, and *How To Train Your Dragon*, for the first time. 
I was just mesmerized by the silver screen. A whole universe was created. A world of new sounds.
A world that has it's own rules. A world which previously never existed. A team of talent, from
various backgrounds, created memorable stories from a blank slate. After I saw these movies, I couldn't
keep my eyes away from the big screen: *Blade Runner*, *Pan's Labyrinth*, *Ernest & Celestine*, 
*Spirited Away*, *Wizard of Oz*, *Coraline*,*Your Name*, *The Lego Movie* and *The Incredibles*. I took
in every film I had access to, and I realized that each movie was created from almost nothing. I especially
love animated movies from Walt Disney, John Lasseter, Brad Bird, Henry Selick, Yoh Yoshinari, Hayao Miyazaki,
and Makoto Shinkai. Why? Unlike a real life medium, where you can use already existing settings (city,mountains,
rooms,ambient sounds), you have to fabricate every detail in an animated film. When I watched *lady and the Tramp*
and *How To Train Your Dragon* I knew I wanted to work in the movie industry. There was no way for me to
accomplish this, until I learned about the possibilities in Computer Science. Which allowed me to do to just that.

**TO CREATE ART WITH TECHNOLOGY!**

My passion for Computer Science lies in **computer graphics**.
Futhermore, I see code as an art medium, and I want to help merge technology and art.

If I can help in any way, please feel free to reach out to me. :D <br /> 
Please contact me if you require further inquiry, or for any opportunity that could advance this field,
as well as my professional development!

P.S. <br /> 
I love movies! Just check out my [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/snowdrgn/films/ "My Letterboxd!") for proof of my love!<br />
