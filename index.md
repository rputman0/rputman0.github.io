## About Me
Welcome to my site! 

I am a CS student at the University of Georgia (UGA), with an emphasis on computer graphics.

During highschool, I made a small "hello world" program. It was a simple program, but I was
excited that I could create something from nothing! From that small program, I now had vast 
possibilities on what I could create, with only my imagination limiting me!

Computer Science correlated with another passion of mine: movies.
I remember watching Lady and the Tramp and How To Train Your Dragon, for the first time. I was 
just mesmerized by the silver screen. A whole universe was created. A world of new sounds.
A world that has it's own rules. A world which previously never existed. A team of talent, from various backgrounds,
created memorable stories from nothing. After I saw these movies, I couldn't keep my eyes
away from the big screen: Blade Runner, Pan's Labyrinth, Ernest & Celestine, Spirited Away, 
Wizard of Oz, Coraline, The Lego Movie and The Incredibles. All these movies are different from tone,genre,
set design, and even production. Yet, they were all created from nothing. I especially love animated
movies from Walt Disney, John Lasseter, Brad Bird, Henry Selick, Yoh Yoshinari, Hayao Miyazaki, and
Makoto Shinkai. Why? Unlike a real life medium, you have to fabricate everything in the movie. The
artist has more control over what happens, and what the environment could be. You have to create 
something from nothing. When I saw these movies, I knew I wanted to work in the movie industry. 
I just did not have a way to do that, until I learned about Computer Science. Which allowed me to do to just that. 

To create art with just technology!

If I can help in any way, please feel free to reach out to me. :D
I am really excited for any opportunity that could advance this field, as well as my professional development!

P.S.
I love movies! Just check out my letterboxd for proof of my love!
